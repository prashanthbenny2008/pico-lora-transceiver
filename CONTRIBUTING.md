# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please open an issue first to discuss it.

If you want to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any new dependencies are added to the documentation.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
3.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
